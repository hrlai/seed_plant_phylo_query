# Making query from the Seed Plant Phylogeny in R

Phylogenetic tree described in Smith and Brown (2018), files downloaded from [FePhyFoFum/big_seed_plant_trees](https://github.com/FePhyFoFum/big_seed_plant_trees). Currently using data [version 0.1](https://github.com/FePhyFoFum/big_seed_plant_trees/releases/tag/v0.1).

This repo is just sharing some `R` codes that make query from their data (e.g. extract a subset of taxa from the giant tree). Please cite Smith and Brown (2018) for their work and data.
